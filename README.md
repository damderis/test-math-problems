# Math Problem Generator - Developer Assessment Starter Kit

## Overview

This is a starter kit for building an AI-powered math problem generator application. The goal is to create a standalone prototype that uses AI to generate math word problems suitable for Primary 5 students, saves the problems and user submissions to a database, and provides personalized feedback.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: Supabase
- **AI Integration**: Google Generative AI (Gemini)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd math-problem-generator
```

### 2. Create a Supabase Project

1. Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a free account
2. Create a new project
3. Go to Settings → API to find your:
   - Project URL (starts with `https://`)
   - Anon/Public Key

### 3. Set Up Database Tables

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste the contents of `database.sql`
3. Click "Run" to create the tables and policies

### 4. Get Google API Key

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create a new API key for Gemini

### 5. Configure Environment Variables

1. Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```
2. Edit `.env.local` and add your actual keys:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_actual_supabase_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_actual_supabase_anon_key
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_google_api_key
   ```

### 6. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 7. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Your Task

### 1. Implement Frontend Logic (`app/page.tsx`)

Complete the TODO sections in the main page component:

- **generateProblem**: Call your API route to generate a new math problem
- **submitAnswer**: Submit the user's answer and get feedback

### 2. Create Backend API Route (`app/api/math-problem/route.ts`)

Create a new API route that handles:

#### POST /api/math-problem (Generate Problem)
- Use Google's Gemini AI to generate a math word problem
- The AI should return JSON with:
  ```json
  {
    "problem_text": "A bakery sold 45 cupcakes...",
    "final_answer": 15
  }
  ```
- Save the problem to `math_problem_sessions` table
- Return the problem and session ID to the frontend

#### POST /api/math-problem/submit (Submit Answer)
- Receive the session ID and user's answer
- Check if the answer is correct
- Use AI to generate personalized feedback based on:
  - The original problem
  - The correct answer
  - The user's answer
  - Whether they got it right or wrong
- Save the submission to `math_problem_submissions` table
- Return the feedback and correctness to the frontend

### 3. Requirements Checklist

- [x] AI generates appropriate Primary 5 level math problems
- [x] Problems and answers are saved to Supabase
- [x] User submissions are saved with feedback
- [x] AI generates helpful, personalized feedback

3. Add your environment variables in Vercel's project settings
4. Deploy!

## Environment Variables

To run this application, you'll need to set up the following environment variables in your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# Google AI Configuration
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key
```

### Getting Your API Keys

1. **Supabase**: 
   - Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a project
   - Find your keys in Settings → API

2. **Google AI**: 
   - Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
   - Create a new API key for Gemini
